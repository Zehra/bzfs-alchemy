# BZFS-Alchemy

> Bypassing the API to try to set a new golden standard for features.

One of the biggest obstacles in trying to develop or create new features are API limitations. The BZFS API contains many useful features, but some techniques are not viable or possible with it.

Thus this small project was born. It's a collection of info on various API bypasses and how to do them, as well as any info associated with them, such as known limitations and issues.

This is mostly for usage as a reference sheet of some sorts, but may eventually become its own library.

* and everything

## Techniques:
| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| False Teleportation | Simulates and mimics teleportation. (Known issue: Flags need to be given to players after each "teleport"). |
| False Countdown | Everything the actual `countdown` timer can do, but without forced game overs. |
| Spawn Team Flag |  Spawns a team flag without players on that team. (Team flag disappears upon any player join or leave.) |
| Freeze Players | Causes all players to `freeze` or resume on demand. |
